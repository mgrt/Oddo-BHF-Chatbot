First, the discounting of available cash flows using the discounting parameters set by the Group and indicated on ODDO BHF’ website. Second, the sum-of-the-parts method based on the most pertinent financial aggregate depending on the sector of activity. Third, we also use the peer comparison method which facilitates an evaluation of the company relative to similar businesses, either because they operate in identical sectors (and are therefore in competition with one another) or because they benefit from comparable financial dynamics. A mixture of these valuation methods may be used in specific instances to more accurately reflect the specific characteristics of each company covered, thereby fine-tuning its evaluation. Sensitivity of the result of the analysis/ risk classification: The opinions expressed in the financial analysis are opinions as per a particular date, i.e. the date indicated in the financial analysis. The recommendation (cf. explanation of the recommendation systematic) can change owing to unforeseeable events which may, for instance, have repercussions on both the company and on the whole industry.\\n\\nOur stock market recommendations Our stock market recommendations reflect the RELATIVE performance expected for each stock on a 12-month timeframe. Outperform: performance expected to exceed that of the benchmark index, sectoral (large caps) or other (small and mid caps). Neutral: performance expected to be comparable to that of the benchmark index, sectoral (large caps) or other (small and mid caps). Underperform: performance expected to fall short of that of the benchmark index, sectoral (large caps) or other (small and mid caps).\\n\\nThe prices of the financial instruments used and mentioned in this document are the closing prices.

The transformation of the portfolio also continued with the goal of becoming a pure-player in specialty products by the end of 2024 (high-emission fluorinated gases are still to be deconsolidated, probably during the next 18 months).\\n\\nFor Q4 2021, we understand there was no notable change in the very positive trends observed in Q3 (however there was pressure in the intermediary acrylic activities in China) and 2022 is expected to be a year of consolidation (meeting in February to inflation is taking time communicate the guidance). The normalisation of (neutral/positive pricing power until now), demand is sometimes difficult to meet (shortages of certain raw materials, particularly in adhesives, expansion investment announced in high performance polymers, the biggest trends remain strong (support from innovation platforms - batteries, lighter materials, high performance adhesives, bio-sourced products, etc.), the new PA11 plant in Singapore will begin operating toward the middle of the year (no contribution to profit anticipated in the first year due to start-up costs), scope effects are set to be relatively low (contribution from acquisitions, from sales, including PMMA), the cyclical turnaround in coating solutions is difficult to predict (objective = EBITDA margin of 16% in 2024 vs. 20% at present).\\n\\nManagement remains focused on executing its 2024 roadmap which should enable a rerating of the valuation multiples. The group is benefiting from the accelerated demand for technological and sustainable solutions (nearly half of sales are aligned with the UN sustainable development goals – 2030 target = 65%) offering a solid outlook (e.g.: sales target in batteries = € 1bn in 2030 vs. <€ 100m in 2019).', metadata={'date': '10/01/2022', 'file_directory': 'test_pdfs', 'filename': 'Mx__364092_3.pdf', 'filetype': 'application/pdf', 'last_modified': '2024-03-27T04:51:18', 'page_number': '5', 'regex_metadata': \"{'Publication date': [{'text': 'Publication date 10/01/2022', 'start': 1099, 'end': 1126}]}\", 'source': 'Mx__364092_3.pdf'})]}"
